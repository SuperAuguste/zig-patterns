//! In Zig, types are first class values, which means you can
//! manipulate types like any other value at compile time.
//!
//! This fact is commonly used in Zig to create type functions (or as I like
//! to call them, typefuncs), which are functions that take in compile
//! time values and return a type.
//!
//! Here, we create an all-encompassing type function, Contribution,
//! that given a summarize function and associated types, will call that
//! function with additional logic.
//!
//! Each call to Contribution with unique parameters returns
//! a unique type.
//!
//! When to use:
//! - When you don't want runtime overhead.
//! - When you want incredibly strong type correctness guarantees.
//!   - This avoids most runtime errors potentially found in other techniques.
//!   - You can also use @compileError to make certain behaviors illegal
//!     100% at compile time.
//! - When you want your structure to be easily extended from Zig code.
//!
//! When not to use:
//! - If you want to store all instances in a variable of a single type
//!   (there is no single type like in the vtable or @fieldParentPtr examples,
//!    so this is not possible).

/// To accept any value of a type created by Contribution, we cannot
/// simply specify a single type due to Contribution returning unique
/// types for unique inputs.
///
/// Zig's solution to this is `anytype`, which allows you
/// to ducktype. As Contribution(X, Y, Z) returns a type
/// with a "summarize" function regardless of the inputs,
/// so we can simply call summarize on our `contrib` parameter.
///
/// As we call summarizeContrib with both a value of type `Issue.C`
/// and `PullRequest.C`, Zig will create two instances of `summarizeContrib`:
/// `summarizeContrib_Issue_C(contrib: Issue.C) Issue.Error!void` and
/// `summarizeContrib_PullRequest_C(contrib: PullRequest.C) PullRequest.Error!void`
///
/// This adds binary size overhead, especially if you have a lot of `summarizeContrib`
/// calls with different input types, but it removes all runtime overhead relating
/// to virtual calls, which many of the polymorphic examples in this repo use,
/// as Zig will simply replace the `summarizeContrib` call with the correct typed call
/// at compile time.
